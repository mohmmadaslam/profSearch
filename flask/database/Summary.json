My early research involved understanding how to simulate caustics (with a focus on caustics through a glass of cognac :-) This lead to the development of photon mapping, which was the first general method capable of simulating global illumination including specular-diffuse-specular paths in complex scenes (including scenes where path tracing and bidirectional path tracing would fail).  Photon mapping is a two-pass method where the first pass involves tracing photons into the model and the second pass is rendering model utilizing the photons for caustics, path guiding, global illumination, and scattering media (including volume caustics).", "GYgP-ogAAAAJ": " Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Science My research aims to advance our understanding of cognitive and adaptive systems by examining how theories, models, and organisms cope with extended uncertainty conditions.

What is the right way to evaluate such models? Reward specification and reward hacking: Human values are too complex to be specified by hand.  How can we infer complex value functions from data? How should an agent make decisions when its value function is approximate due to noise in the data or inadequacies in the model? How can we prevent reward hacking--degenerate policies that exploit differences between the inferred and true reward?", "LYy73WkAAAAJ": " HCI and systems researcher; Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information I conduct research at the intersection of Systems and HCI.

Why are they so terrifyingly insecure? The problem is many-faceted, but an important aspect is that people who develop software must consider a huge number of possible executions of their code, and the human mind doesn't turn out to be all that good at this.  Even a single execution of a medium-sized piece of software can be mind-numbingly complex, requiring many hours before an expert can understand what is going on. The part of the solution to the software problem that I am most interested in is using software tools to make it easier to develop correct and efficient software.  Basically, we can create programs to show us possibilities inherent in our software -- such as crashes -- that we did not know about, or better yet create programs to verify that such possibilities do not exist.  Similarly, good abstractions such as high-level programming languages make it easier to express our intent, and then we can offload to software tools the problem of making programs run quickly.", "xuguQ60AAAAJ": " UMD Department of Computer Science Toggle navigation Computer Vision & Machine Perception High Performance & Scientific Computing Information Retrieval and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Machine Learning & Data Science", "6CmLTEwAAAAJ": "", "osLwYNIAAAAJ": " School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  Box 2752, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Bldg. , University of Washington, Electrical Engineering, 1991. , University of Washington, Electrical Engineering, 1985. , Summa Cum Laude, Tulane University, Electrical Engineering, 1983.", "1iE2ykkAAAAJ": " John S Shawe-Taylor is a professor at University College London (UK).
